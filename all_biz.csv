What happens to kuna (HRK) when Croatia adopts the euro (EUR) as its currency?,"From 1 January 2023, Croatia will discontinue the kuna currency and adopt the euro as its official currency.As a result, Revolut Business will no longer provide services supporting kuna from 12 December 2022. Your kuna currency account will be closed and we'll convert any remaining kuna balances you hold to euros. Read on to learn more.1. If you hold any kuna balance with us, that balance will be converted to euro automatically on 12 December 2022 at a fixed rate of 7.53450 kunas per euro. This conversion will occur automatically, free of charge, and won't change your unique account number.You can still use your kuna or convert it to any other currency of your choice before this date. (As part of a government campaign, citizens are being advised not to exchange kuna for euro before the euro is introduced. This is mostly so people don't incur any unnecessary costs. Before the changeover, banks won't be obliged to exchange kuna at the fixed, official rate. This means citizens who exchange their kuna into euro before the date of the introduction will be charged the difference between the selling rate set by a bank, or an authorised exchange office, and the fixed conversion rate).We'll remove kuna as a supported currency, so you won't be able to hold or exchange it, from 12 December 2022.2. If you don't hold any Kuna balance with us, this change won't impact you. But please note this currency will be removed from our list of supported currencies going forward.3. All regular fees payable for subscriptions, transactions services, etc. will be charged in euros instead of kuna from 12 December 2022. There are no changes to our T&Cs concerning how fees are calculated and charged, so you won't experience any additional costs as a result of this currency change.",100,https://help.revolut.com/business/help/setting-up-an-account/managing-my-currency-accounts/what-happens-to-kuna-hrk-when-croatia-adopts-the-euro-eur-as-its-currency

Sending SWIFT transfers,"SWIFT payments are a type of international transfer sent via the SWIFT international payment network. The SWIFT international payment network is one of the largest financial messaging systems in the world. You can send and receive SWIFT payments using your Revolut Business account.Unlike many banks, we don't automatically charge SWIFT payments as international payments because sometimes we make a transfer between parties within the same country in order to allow for things like higher transfer limits. This is because we understand that for businesses sometimes the ability to send large amounts in a single payment is more important than a fee for the payment, for example. We often treat such payments as local payments in order to save our customers paying any fees. For more information on how we classify local and international payments, please see here.When the money is in transit, correspondent and intermediary banks may also deduct their handling fees. Unfortunately, we don't have control over these fees and they are deducted from the final amount that the recipient will receive. However, when you send an eligible international payment with us, you can ensure the recipient receives the full payment/transfer amount by using our Guaranteed SWIFT (OUR) Transfer feature. This allows you to choose to pay the full fee yourself. You can view more details on our fees page.To make a SWIFT transfer:Simply click 'Send' on your Business account Home pageClick the plus sign (+) to add a new counterparty OR select one from the listChoose between Guaranteed SWIFT (OUR) or SWIFT (SHA) for applicable payment routesContinue with steps on-screen.SWIFT transfers are usually sent using IBAN and BIC/SWIFT code. If input fields say something else, i.e. Account number, this should be a better (faster or cheaper) option available and you should use the Account number instead.The same applies to receive a SWIFT transfer.If you have any troubles with the transfer, please reach out and submit a support request here.",100,https://help.revolut.com/business/help/receiving-payments/sending-money-to-an-external-bank-account/swift-transfers

Exchange rates,"We strongly recommend that you always choose to pay and withdraw in the local currency when abroad as some merchants and ATM machines will charge you in your base currency and then apply their own foreign exchange fees on top, making it so that the funds get technically exchanged twice. First, in Revolut in your base currency and then, on the ATM level to that country's local currency. ATM providers are trying to make a profit on each transaction. When they recognise that you are using a card from a foreign country, they use this opportunity to apply their own exchange rate.We use the real exchange rate for money currency exchanges, and don't add any markups to it. The “real” rate can mean different things to different people (and can be given different names, like the “interbank” rate). Here at Revolut, the real exchange rate means the buy and sell rates we have determined based on the foreign exchange market data feeds we consume from a range of different independent sources.When exchanging currencies with Revolut, fees might apply. If any fees were charged on your card payment or cash withdrawal, you can see it by tapping on the specific transaction in your transactions list.

What are Direct Debits?,"A Direct Debit is an automated payment method that gives someone else – the merchant – authority to withdraw money from your bank account at regular intervals. Direct debits are often for things that require regular payments, like gym memberships, bills, or mortgages.You can set up as many Direct Debits as you need, and the service is free of charge at Revolut, but we can’t prevent a beneficiary bank from applying a fee as the money is received. Currently, Direct Debits you have set up aren't visible in the Revolut Business app.This feature is supported in both British Pounds and Euros. We offer a Core Direct Debits scheme which allows the beneficiary to collect funds from your Business account.

How can I cancel a direct debit?,"The way to cancel a direct debit on your account depends on whether it is denominated in GBP (which is made through the BACS scheme) or in EUR (which is made through the SEPA scheme).To cancel a local GBP direct debit: Go to your last direct debit payment in the transactions section of the Revolut app and ‘cancel the transaction’ from ‘completed payments’. You can cancel a UK direct debit before 4pm (UK time) on the business day that it is due. If you’ve missed this cut-off, don’t worry as you may be entitled to a refund for that particular transaction and you’ll still be able to cancel future direct debit payments as long as you do so before the cut off. You can ask us for a refund in relation to the direct debit transaction by making a Direct Debit Indemnity Claim on your behalf. Whether you are entitled to a refund will depend on the rules of the BACS scheme.To deactivate any future EUR Direct Debit transactions:Go to the ‘Payments’ section of the app and open 'Scheduled' tab. Select the direct debit you wish to cancel, click 'Delete' and follow the instructions. If it’s too late to cancel your direct debit and you are charged for the amount, you will be entitled to an unconditional refund if you contact us within eight weeks of the date the payment was taken from your account.Once a Direct Debit is cancelled, it cannot be restored. Please note, our Support team is not able to cancel direct debits on your account. If you are unable to cancel a direct debit on your account yourself, you may still be entitled to a refund so please get in touch with Support.",100,https://help.revolut.com/business/help/receiving-payments/direct-debits/how-can-i-cancel-a-direct-debit
Why was my Direct Debit declined?,"There can be a few reasons.Usually, it’s because you don’t have enough money associated to the currency account from which the Direct Debit was set from. Funds must be in the same currency account that was used for setting up the Direct Debit. For example: if you set up a GBP Direct Debit, and provided the merchant with details from your GBP currency account, you must have enough money in that account to cover the Direct Debit paymentsIt's always worth double checking with the merchant if they have your correct account details. For GBP it's your GBP account number and sort code. For EUR, it's your EUR IBAN and BIC code.The limit of a single EUR Direct Debit payment is 10,000 EUR. There is no limit for GBP Direct Debits.Make sure the beneficiary is setting up a Core Direct Debit scheme, as we do not support B2B (but we're working on it!)If your Direct Debit is still failing, contact our support team, and we’ll be happy to help.",100,https://help.revolut.com/business/help/receiving-payments/direct-debits/why-was-my-direct-debit-declined

If the mandate relating to the Direct Debit was not authorised by you, you can request a refund up to 13 months after the date your account was debited.

How can I reduce the chance of disputes on my Merchant account?,"You can help reduce the chance of disputes by following these guidelines.Give accurate descriptions and set clear expectationsCustomers often raise disputes because there’s a discrepancy between the goods or services they paid for and what they received. To reduce the chance of this happening:Give a detailed description of the products or services you sell and always use accurate imagesBe clear about terms and conditions, your shipping and returns policy, and privacy policyGive your customers regular status updates so they know what’s going on with their orderSave documents and recordsAll paperwork and communications relating to a sale can be used as evidence in a dispute. So make sure you keep everything, including invoices, shipping documents, proof of delivery, and any emails or messages between you and your customers.Make it easy for customers to contact youCustomers are more likely to raise a dispute if they can’t get in touch with your company or if no one replies to them. Being clear about how people can contact you and always responding quickly can help reduce the number of disputes raised against you.Check where transactions come fromPeople can raise disputes with you if their card has been stolen or cloned and subsequently used to buy something from your business. So it’s a good idea to check if the country where the card was issued matches the delivery address. If these countries differ, there’s a higher chance that the customer is using a stolen card. You can also check Google Maps to see if delivery addresses are valid.Watch out for unusual transactionsPay attention to unusual transaction patterns. This could be multiple transactions in a row from the same customer or orders from countries you don’t usually sell to.

How does Revolut protect merchants and their customers from fraud?,"Revolut makes it easier for merchants to be compliant and transact securely by complying with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), aligning with Payment Services Directive 2 Strong Customer Authentication (PSD2 SCA) and 3 Domain Secure (3DS), and through continual transaction monitoring.PCI DSSPCI DSS states that merchants need to hold and handle data securely. Revolut systems take the burden of responsibility away from merchants by only allowing them to see the last four digits of their customers' card numbers. We also restrict merchants' access to their customers' data.PSD2 SCAFollowing EU legislation known as PSD2, we pass the majority of transactions through Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) to make sure they're as secure as possible. This means your customers have to verify their identity in two out of three ways: with something they have (e.g. a mobile phone), know (e.g. a password or PIN) or are (e.g. fingerprint or facial recognition).3DSAs part of SCA, we also use 3DS. This verifies your customers' identities by redirecting them to the secure environment of their card issuer. Once they've passed through 3DS, they're sent back to your website to complete the transaction.Transaction monitoringWe have specialist internal and external platforms that monitor transactions across our entire payment system, not just merchant payments. This helps us judge whether a transcation should be accepted or declined. It also helps protect merchants against transactions made with stolen cards.",100,https://help.revolut.com/business/help/merchant-accounts/fraud-protection-for-my-merchant-account/how-does-revolut-protect-merchants-and-their-customers-from-fraud
Will Revolut's fraud protection impact my business?,"Stronger Customer Authentication (SCA) protects your business, but it can lead to fewer successful transactions as it declines potentially fraudulent ones, which can impact your business.With that said, we assess the overall fraud rate across our platform, and if it's low enough, we'll allow more transactions to bypass SCA, reducing the overall impact.",100,https://help.revolut.com/business/help/merchant-accounts/fraud-protection-for-my-merchant-account/will-revolut-s-fraud-protection-impact-my-business
What transactions to Merchant account are exempt from SCA?,"Low-risk or low-value transactions of £30 / €30 or less are usually exempt from Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). 'One leg out transactions' – where the merchant is in the EEA but the customer isn't – are also exempt. At any given time, if the overall rate of fraudulent transactions is low enough to be compliant with Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2), we may allow some higher value transactions to skip SCA. As a merchant, you can choose to turn off these exceptions so all your customers' transactions are subject to SCA and pass through 3 Domain Security (3DS). At the moment, we don't allow merchants to opt out of SCA or set their own risk appetite.",100,https://help.revolut.com/business/help/merchant-accounts/fraud-protection-for-my-merchant-account/what-transactions-to-merchant-account-are-exempt-from-sca
